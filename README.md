# Project Objective:

This project allows us to have deep understanding of how data can be generated, stored and utilized to solve business problems. In any business, data generation is a very important step which can help answer various business questions. To understand the data generation process, it is important to know the end to end business activity that happens on a daily basis. This assignment gives us an opportunity to build a business scenario based on our personal experience. As a part of the business analysis, we built a database to replicate 10 customers based on our ‘requirements analysis’.

The sample dataset for this analysis was generated based on the information present in the reciept/bill from my visit to a local food market.
